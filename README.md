# 🧠 EasyMode – Personalized Simplicity for Everyone

> Because apps shouldn’t be confusing — they should feel like they were built just for you.

## 🗣️ What is EasyMode?

Every day, millions of people struggle with apps that feel confusing, cluttered, or not made for them. From elders like my dad, to people who speak local languages, to children and first-time tech users — most apps leave them behind.

**EasyMode** is a personalized UI experience layer that adapts layouts, simplifies language, and only shows what you need — based on how *you* use the app.

Whether it’s a banking app, a shopping platform, or a streaming site, EasyMode makes the experience:
- ✨ Friendlier
- 🌍 Localized
- 🎯 Personalized
- 👶 Simple enough for anyone to use

> “So simple a three-year-old can understand it.”  
That’s what my dad said apps should feel like — and that became my North Star. I built EasyMode to make tech feel human again.
